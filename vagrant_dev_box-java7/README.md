Vagrant Development Box
==================
This is a simple Vagrant box that installs **gcc/g++** compilers, **Python** and **Pip**, Oracle **Java 7**, and the latest **Ruby**; **RVM**; and **Rails**. The box is Ubuntu 12.04 *(Precise Pangolin)* 64-bit, and uses a simple shell file for provisioning instead of Puppet or Chef at the moment. This config works on Vagrant 1.4.3 properly.
