# it is NOT idempotent and will result in duplicate keys in authorized_keys if run a 2nd time
# in this lower security approach there is just one key pair used across every node
# we don't want a permanent set for whole cluster so it can't go in BakeCalavera.sh
# (tempting but we need at least adequate security)
# nor do we want keys in github, so both .ssh and rsa* are in gitignore.

# Ok here is the business rule
# ssh.sh is run out of calavera::default chef recipe
#
# and checks that the key pair exists in /mnt/shared/keys (this directory must be shared across the cluster)
# generates if it does not
# force copies keys to ~/.ssh
# (to reset all keys delete /mnt/shared/keys and kitchen/vagrant destroy/up)
