# this is a tricky file
# we don't want a gitignore here in terms of calavera github
# but when manos is instantiated and hijo is moved over to its own home directory
# then we need a gitignore
# so this file is correctly renamed as part of the move process
.vagrant/   # probably don't need to worry about this
target/*    # things built on dev workstation do not go in source control
*.class
