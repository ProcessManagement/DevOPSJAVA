#java-development

Description
===========

Configures a virtual server with Tomcat installed to be used on a development workstation with the IntelliJ IDE.

**PLEASE NOTE:** The configuration settings in the template `sentenv.sh.erb` open up JXM ports for remote administration
**in an unsecure manager**. Specifically, the CATALINA_OPTS options jmxremote.ssl and jmxremote.authenticate are both set to false
which means this configuration is not secure. This is acceptable for a local development environment that is only
accessible from the host workstation. However, this is not acceptable for staging and definitely not production. Change
this template for these environments to include SSL and authentication.

Requirements
============

Platform:

* CentOS

The following cookbooks are dependencies:

* java
* tomcat_latest

Attributes
==========


* `node['java-development']['tomcat-user'] = "admin"` - Sets the user name for the Tomcat administer for the web-based Tomcat management tool
* `node['java-development']['tomcat-user-password'] = "secret"` - Sets the password for the Tomcat administrator
* `node['java-development']['jmx-remote-port'] = "1099"` - Sets the Tomcat JXM port. This is used by IntelliJ to manage Tomcat remotely.
* `node['java-development']['internal-ipaddress'] =  node[:network][:interfaces][:eth1][:addresses].detect{|k,v| v[:family] == "inet" }.first` - This
is the internal (192.168.*) address assigned to the virtual host. The host also has a 10.* IP address which we don't want.
* `node['java-development']['app-dir'] = 'myapp'` - This is the directory under the "webapps" directory in Tomcat that is used for our application
* `node['java-development']['jdwp-socket'] = '49174'` - The JDWP socket is used for remote debugging in IntelliJ. This should match with the port specified in the Debug Run Configuration in IntelliJ.
* `node['java-development']['tomcat-home'] = "#{node['tomcat_latest']['tomcat_install_loc']}/tomcat#{node['tomcat_latest']['tomcat_version']}/
apache-tomcat-#{node['tomcat_latest']['tomcat_version']}"` - This is a convenience variable so we can easily access the Tomcat home directory our Recipes and Templates



Usage
=====

Include this cookbook when you want to setup a Java development workstation to do remote deployment and debugging
on a local virtual server running Tomcat
