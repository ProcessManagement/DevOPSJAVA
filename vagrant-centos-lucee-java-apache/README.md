##### Last Updated June 9, 2015
---

### Prerequisites
NOTE: All version numbers used in this document are confirmed to work, and are current, as of the time of this writing

#### Required
It is assumed you have Virtual Box and Vagrant installed. If not, then grab the latest version of each at the links below:
* [Virtual Box and Virtual Box Guest Additions](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (4.3.26)
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) (v1.7.2)

#### Highly Recommended
Once Vagrant is installed, or if it already is, it's highly recommended that you install the following Vagrant plugins:
* [vagrant-hostsupdater](https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater) (v0.0.11).
```$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater```
* [vagrant-vbguest](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest) (v0.10.0).
```$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest```

---

### What's Included
* CentOS 6.6 64bit
	* Make sure curl, wget, unzip, zip, iptables, net-tools are installed
	* Set vm timezone (configure in Vagrantfile)
* Apache 2.4
	* Set up to serve all static content and reverse-proxy cfm/cfc/jsp requests to Lucee
* MySQL 5.1.73
	* lower_case_table_names = 1 (disables case sensitivity)
	* bind-address set to 0.0.0.0 so database server can be accessed from the host machine directly (without ssh tunnel)
	* any SQL files found in the vagrantroot/data directory will be restored to a database with the same name as the SQL file
* Lucee 4.5.1.000

---

### Installation
The first time you clone the repo and bring the box up, it may take several minutes. If it doesn't explicitly fail/quit, then it is still working.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:dskaggs/vagrant-centos-lucee.git
$ cd vagrant-centos-lucee && vagrant up
```

Once the Vagrant box finishes and is ready, you should see something like this in your terminal:
```
==> default: Lucee-Dev-v0.1.0
==> default:
==> default: ========================================================================
==> default:
==> default: http://www.lucee.dev (192.168.50.25)
==> default:
==> default: Lucee Server/Web Context Administrators
==> default:
==> default: http://www.lucee.dev:8888/lucee/admin/server.cfm
==> default: http://www.lucee.dev:8888/lucee/admin/web.cfm
==> default:
==> default: Password (for each admin): password
==> default:
==> default:
==> default: Webmin
==> default: " "
==> default: https://www.lucee.dev:10000
==> default: User: root
==> default: Password: vagrant
==> default: " "
==> default: " "
==> default: Database Server Connection Info for External Connections
==> default: from Host Machine
==> default:
==> default: Server: db.lucee.dev
==> default: Port: 3306
==> default: User: root
==> default: Password: password
==> default:
==> default: ========================================================================
```
Once you see that, you should be able to browse to [http://www.lucee.dev/](http://www.lucee.dev/)
or [http://192.168.50.25/](http://192.168.50.25/)
(it may take a few minutes the first time a page loads after bringing your box up, subsequent requests should be much faster).

**NOTE**
* On Windows (host machines) you should run your terminal as an Administrator; you will also need to make sure your Hosts file isn't set to read-only if you want to take advantage of the hostname functionality. Alternatively, simply use the IP address anywhere you would use the hostname (connecting to database server, etc).
* The VM is configured to share the www folder in the project root into the webroot of the VM at /var/www/sites. This is where you should put the CFML code that you want to run with Lucee.
