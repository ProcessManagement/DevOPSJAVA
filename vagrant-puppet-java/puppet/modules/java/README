Java puppet module

This puppet module is based on bcarpio/java_jdk 0.0.2. bcarpio/java_jdk does not set path for exec object. Although the git repos of that module is merged with a pull request to solve that problem, its puppet module on forge is not updated accordingly. This module is uploaded to solve that.

Usage

Downloading java jdk (tested with jdk1.7.0_03) from Oracle and renaming it as jdk1.7.0_03.tar.gz in files/. Then defining this module in your site.pp:

node 'your puppet agent node' {
    include java
}
